 * Given a sorted integer array arr, two integers k and x, return the k closest integers to x in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order.
 *
 * An integer a is closer to x than an integer b if:
 *
 * |a - x| < |b - x|, or
 * |a - x| == |b - x| and a < b
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = 3
 * Output: [1,2,3,4]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 4, x = -1
 * Output: [1,2,3,4]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= k <= arr.length
 * 1 <= arr.length <= 104
 * arr is sorted in ascending order.
 * -104 <= arr[i], x <= 104
